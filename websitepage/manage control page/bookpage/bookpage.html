Is it hurting you and your business? Are critical IT decisions being made by the right people in your organization? In many small to medium-sized companies, key Business decisions are being made by the IT support folks (geeks), while Technology decisions are being made by management. Too often signals get mixed and decisions with less than ideal judgment or clarity are made. You don't need to become a geek to make the best decisions or to grasp what your technology people are telling you, you just have to develop some insight and intuition to the perspective between the two worlds so you can most effectively do your job. This manual to success will not turn you into a geek. It will however teach you the important concepts behind the impact that Information Technology has on businesses of today, and the responsibility of management to understand IT.</p></div>
